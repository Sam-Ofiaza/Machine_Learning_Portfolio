# Machine_Learning_Portfolio
A portfolio of work completed in my Intro to Machine Learning course

## Overview of ML
View an overview [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf).

## Data Exploration
View a short [document](Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.pdf) and the [code](Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp).
To run the code, change the path in inFS.open() to the absolute path of wherever you have 'Boston.csv', navigate to where you downloaded the cpp file, and run g++ data_exploration.cpp -o data_exploration -static; ./data_exploration

## Linear Models
View the [Regression](Linear_Models/Regression_on_the_Kaggle_Dataset_Medals_Data_Set.pdf) and [Classification](Linear_Models/Classification_on_the_Kaggle_Dataset_Medals_Data_Set.pdf) pdfs. To run the notebooks, download the linked data set, extract the files, and use dataset_medal_total.csv

## ML Algorithms from Scratch
View a short [document](ML_Algos_from_Scratch/ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf) and the associated C++ files in the same folder.
To run the code, change the path in inFS.open() to the absolute path of wherever you have 'titanic_project.csv', navigate to where you downloaded the cpp file, and run the following:\
g++ log_reg.cpp -o log_reg -static; ./log_reg\
g++ naive_bayes.cpp -o naive_bayes -static; ./naive_bayes

## sklearn
View a [demo](sklearn.ipynb) with logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks in Python.
