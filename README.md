# Machine_Learning_Portfolio
A portfolio of work completed in my Intro to Machine Learning course

## Overview of ML
View an overview [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf).

## Data Exploration
View a short [document](Data_Exploration/Data_Exploration.pdf) and the [code](Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp).
To run the code, change the path in inFS.open() to the absolute path of wherever you have 'Boston.csv', navigate to where you downloaded the cpp file, and run g++ data_exploration.cpp -o data_exploration -static; ./data_exploration

## Linear Models
View the [Regression](Linear_Models/Regression_on_the_Kaggle_Dataset_Medals_Data_Set.pdf) and [Classification](Linear_Models/Classification_on_the_Kaggle_Dataset_Medals_Data_Set.pdf) pdfs. To run the notebooks, download the linked data set, extract the files, and use dataset_medal_total.csv

## ML Algorithms from Scratch
View a short [document](ML_Algos_from_Scratch/ML_Algorithms_&#32;from_Scratch.pdf) and the associated C++ files in the same folder.
To run the code, change the path in inFS.open() to the absolute path of wherever you have 'titanic_project.csv', navigate to where you downloaded the cpp file, and run the following:\
g++ log_reg.cpp -o log_reg -static; ./log_reg\
g++ naive_bayes.cpp -o naive_bayes -static; ./naive_bayes

## Neural Networks in Python with sklearn
View a [demo](sklearn.ipynb) with logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks in Python.

## Image Multiclass Classification in Python
View the [notebook](Image_Multiclass_Classification/Image_Classification&#32;(1).ipynb) classifying x-rays of various types of brain tumors using a sequential model, CNN, and transfer learning.

## Technical and Soft Skills Learned
- Communication - used Discord to effectively coordinate meeting times and equally split work
- Scheduling - used when2meet to display several complex schedules to find appropriate meeting times
- Time and project management - relied on a project leader to establish deadlines and enforce them
- Analytical thinking - combined in-class resources and online problem-solving to complete assignments
- Flexibility - adjusted to rapid deadline changes based on other teammates' availability
- Ability to work in a team or independently - respected others' time and delivered project components on time

## Course Summary
Overall, this class was a lot of fun and helped me gain insight into traditional and modern machine learning algorithms. The most helpful parts of this class were learning the ML workflow, understanding the importance of choosing and cleaning the right data sets, and working around data formats to fit particular algorithm implementations. I'm planning to use Python's ML packages to work with other web development projects. I'm especially excited to see what new developments will come out of this field in the future!
